Red
I'm talking 'bout the sun coming up, and the sun going down
On a John Deere turning up a hard work check
Making that blue collar country boy's neck
Red
I'm talking 'bout the color of them jerseys on a Friday night
At the end of another long hot dry summer
'Tween the dust and the rust the trucks are half covered in
Red
Like a bloodhound
Tracking some white tail buck down

I ain't talking politics, I'm talking small town
And if you're from one you know what I'm talking 'bout
It's everywhere I swear from the courthouse bricks
To a crushed bud heavy can fading in the ditch
Like the book of John, like a barn door
And heart your hands over cause you're thankful for
Every shipped off soul that was born to fight
For a wind torn flag that's blue and white
And red

Red
I'm talkin' 'bout a county line stop sign full of bird shot
The cup your beer's in sitting 'round a fire
Like your, bank account when you bought them tires
That led
You down a dirt road and got some red lips leaning cross the console

I ain't talking politics, I'm talking small town
And if you're from one you know what I'm talking 'bout
It's everywhere I swear from the courthouse bricks
To a crushed bud heavy can fading in the ditch
Like the book of John, like a barn door
And heart your hands over 'cause you're thankful for
Every shipped off soul that was born to fight
For a wind torn flag that's blue and white
And red

It don't matter who you are, got your back if that's what you need
'Cause at the end of the day hey we all bleed
Red

I ain't talking politics, I'm talking small town
And if you're from one you know what I'm talking 'bout
It's everywhere I swear from the courthouse bricks
To a crushed bud heavy can fading in the ditch
Like the book of John, like a barn door
And heart your hands over cause you're thankful for
Every shipped off soul that was born to fight
For a wind torn flag that's blue and white
And red
Yeah a wind torn flag that's blue and white
And red
Yeah a wind torn flag that's blue and white
And red
